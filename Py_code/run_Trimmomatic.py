This module performs read pre-processing:
- removes read pairs were the sequence contains >= 25 Gs
- trims reads with Trimmomatic

Removal of poly-Gs:
  If the Illumina base reader doesn't know what to call a base, it designates 
  it as "G", which can result in a lot of poly-G reads and high coverage 
  contigs that are poly-G. The remove_poly_Gs() function removes all reads 
  with more than 25 Gs in a row and their paired read as well.

Read pre-processing with Trimmomatic:
- Pre-processing of raw reads: adapter trimming, removal of low quality bases
  and of unpaired reads
- Renames the original read files by adding the prefix 'raw_', and moving them 
  to the temp folder.
- Extraction of data from the trimmomatic_log file and writing to the report

Trimmomatic Pre-processing steps:
- Remove Illumina adapters: 'ILLUMINACLIP:PATH/NexteraPE-PE.fa:2:30:10'
- Remove leading and trailing low quality bases: LEADING:3, TRAILING:3
- Scan the read with a 4-base wide sliding window, cutting when the average 
  quality per base drops below a phred score of 20: SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20
- Drop reads shorter than 100 bp: MINLEN:100
- Trimmomatic outputs four files, two with paired and two with unpaired reads; 
  use only files with paired f- and r-reads for further steps.
